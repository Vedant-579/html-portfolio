  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi! I'm <strong>Vedant Kokare</strong>, an aspiring <strong>Software Engineer</strong> and 
    <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> from Pune, Maharashtra. I’m passionate about building 
    scalable, user-friendly applications and exploring the intersection of technology and finance.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently pursuing a <strong>B.E. in Computer Science</strong> from 
    Pune Vidyarthi Griha’s College of Engineering and Technology (PVGCOET). 
    My academic journey has helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding 
    of software design, data structures, and machine learning concepts.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think analytically and creatively — 
    from building web applications with <strong>React.js</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong> 
    to developing data-driven tools using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>scikit-learn</strong>. 
    I’ve also solved over <strong>200+ DSA problems</strong> on GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode, 
    continuously improving my coding logic.
  </p>
<p>
  My goal is to contribute to innovative products that make technology accessible, efficient, 
  and impactful. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and grow as a developer and problem solver.
</p>
